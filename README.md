# BeginnerJavaProjects
I have now been learning Java for a short while, and have made my first two beginner java project. They are quite simple - They utilize:

- Scanner class
- If, else and else If statements
- Logical operators
- For loops
- While Loops
- Methods
- Arrays



There will be more projects to come soon!

Please feel free to tell me any improvements I can make.
