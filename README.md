# BeginnerJavaProject
I have now been learning Java for a short while, and have made my first beginner java project. It is quite simple, (Since it is beginner friendly), it utilizes the Scanner class to collect User Input, it also utilizes if statements, logical operators, arrays and loops. There will be more projects to come soon!
