# BeginnerJavaProject
I have now been learning Java for a short while, and have made my first beginner java project. It is quite simple, (Since it is beginner friendly), it utilizes the Scanner class to collect User Input, it also utilizes if statements, logical operators, arrays and loops. There will be more projects to come soon!

Please feel free to tell me any improvements I can make.

How to run

Make sure you have Java installed.

Save Main.java in a folder.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:

javac Main.java
java Main


Follow the prompts in the program to enter your subjects and grades.

Notes

The program supports up to 3 subjects for now.

It prints all the grades at the end.
