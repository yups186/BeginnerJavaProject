# BeginnerJavaProjects
I have now been learning Java for a short while, and have made my first two beginner java project. They are quite simple - They utilize:

- Scanner class
- If, else and else If statements
- Logical operators
- For loops
- While Loops
- Methods
- Arrays



There will be more projects to come soon!

Please feel free to tell me any improvements I can make.

How to run

Make sure you have Java installed.

Save Main.java in a folder.

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:

javac NAMEOFJAVAPROJECTHERE.java

java NAMEOFJAVAPROJECTHERE


# For the Grades Project

Follow the prompts in the program to enter your subjects and grades.

Notes

The program supports up to 3 subjects for now.

It prints all the grades at the end.

# For the Banking App Project

Follow the prompts in the program to either:

- Find out your Balance
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Exit

Notes

Using deposit or withdraw will dynamically update the original Balance (with the exception of if Withdrawing exceeds the original Balance, that somehow breaks the Balance value, I will try to fix this as soon as possible.)

# For the Quiz Game Project

Contains 3 questions with score tracking;

Notes

Code is a bit messy, could probably try utilise 2D Arrays instead. At the moment, it does not take into account casing or white spaces, however I will add that to the code in a later commit.

Thank you for reading.
